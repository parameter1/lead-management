# Lead Management Monorepo

## Installation
To set up a local developer environment using this repo, execute the following commands:
```sh
docker compose run --entrypoint /usr/local/bin/yarn manage
docker compose run --entrypoint /usr/local/bin/yarn server
```

Then, the following commands to boot the server and ember applications:
```sh
docker compose up manage
```

The application will now be available on http://localhost:9285 (and the API on http://localhost:9288).

## Releases
This repo contains two projects -- the `manage` ember application, and the `monorepo`. Both of the versions for these projects must remain in sync.
Before releasing the monorepo, check if changes to the ember application should be deployed. If so, increment the ember app's package.json version accordingly before releasing via lerna.

For example, if the `monorepo` is at version `1.2.3`, the ember app is at `1.2.3`, and a new feature was added:
1. Increment and commit the `version` in the `manage` application's `package.json` file manually to match the expected lerna version (`1.3.0`).
2. Release the monorepo: `cd monorepo; lerna version minor`

2. Add tenant to `lead-management.tenants` on Aquaria
3. Add permissions to LM user `db.grantRolesToUser('lead-management', [{ role: 'readWrite', db: 'lead-management-TENANTKEY' }])`
4. Generate DB/Indexes: Set tenant key and boot dev instance to auto-index
